- Initialize project
- Start building API
- Set up project settings, database, initial project urls
- Set up initial models for:
    [Restaurants, Food, Music, Travel // Tags, Tags2Entry]
        > Each entry can be associated to tags - may choose existing or create new
        > this will help with searchability and browsability
- Set up serializers
- Set up generic view sets
- Set up api urls with router

TODO LATER : Look into best way to implement tagging system
TODO LATER : Look into benefit of hyperlinking (performance)
